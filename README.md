# ProxyGod by zwennnnn

The Ultimate Proxy Scraper & Checker by zwennnnn.

## Features
- **Hacker Theme UI**: Powered by `rich`.
- **Async Speed**: Ultra-fast checking with `aiohttp` and reliable concurrency.
- **Smart Rotation**: Uses random judge servers (Google, Cloudflare, Firefox, Httpbin) to prevent rate-limiting and ensure false-free results.
- **Multi-Protocol**: Supports HTTP, SOCKS4, SOCKS5.
- **Smart Export**: Automatically saves live proxies to `output/`.

## Setup

1. Install Python (Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation).
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

- If you have an `advanced.name` daily link, paste it when prompted.
- Watch the magic happen!

## Understanding Results (Live vs Dead)

You might notice a high number of "Dead" proxies compared to "Live" ones (e.g., getting 300 live out of 20,000). **This is completely normal and expected.**

- **Strict Checking:** THIS TOOL DOES NOT JUST PING. It performs a **strict connection test** (making a real finding request to a judge server). Many proxies respond to ping but fail to forward data. We only give you proxies that **actually work**.
- **Public Nature:** Free public proxies are used by thousands of people simultaneously. They are short-lived, unstable, and often overloaded.
- **Quality > Quantity:** Finding 100-500 *truly working* proxies is far more valuable than a list of 10,000 "maybe working" IPs.

## Verification

Don't just take our word for it! You can verify the quality of the exported proxies yourself using third-party check tools.

We recommend **[Proxyway Free Online Proxy Checker](https://proxyway.com/tools/free-online-proxy-checker)** (Highly Recommended) or **[Hide.mn Proxy Checker](https://hide.mn/tr/proxy-checker/)**.

Simply upload the `output/http.txt`, `output/socks4.txt` or `output/socks5.txt` files generated by ProxyGod to confirm they are indeed live and working.
